* Click [here](dose_response_curve_fitting_with_errorbars.html) for the script that fits four-parameter logistics to concentration-response curve data. These fits help us calculate the "predicted trajectory" of mutants under imatinib selection.

* Click [here](spikeins_depthofcoverages.html) for analysis looking at whether we achieved our desired depth of coverages


* Click [here](spikeins_data_parser.html) for the data parsing script that parses duplex sequencing spike-in data. This code also calculates inferred mutant counts. The resulting data is used in scripts later.

* Click [here](spikeins_growthrates.html) for plots showing how depletion artifacts are corrected when using inferred mutant counts. Also shows the percent error decrease when using mutant count instead of allele fraction

* Click [here](E255K_alphas_figure.html) for analyses showing our GFP-tagged mutant standard (E255K-GFP). Specifically, we're looking at the agreement in growth rates of E255K measured via FACs, sequencing, and as they are predicted by IC50 studies.

* Click [here](enrichment_simulations.html) for simulations of resistance in a 3 mutant pool. These simulations show how quikcly a fit (more resistant) mutant dominates the population. This allele frequency domination of the most fit mutant causes depletion artifacts that are visible in our spikein data. A simulation with 20 mutants, not 3, is also present.
